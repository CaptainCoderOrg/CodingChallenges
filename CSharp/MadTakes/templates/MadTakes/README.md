# Mad Takes Challenge

A Mad Take is a silly word game where the user is prompted to enter types of
words. Then, those words are substituted into stories, conversations, and songs
to create ridiculous outcomes! 

You can play some Mad Takes here: [https://www.madtakes.com/index.php](https://www.madtakes.com/index.php)

## Starter Project

To help you get started, there is a short Mad Take program provided in
[Program.cs](Program.cs). You can run it by typing `dotnet run` in your terminal.

## Overview

`Console.ReadLine`, and `Console.ForegroundColor` to create a Mad Take!
