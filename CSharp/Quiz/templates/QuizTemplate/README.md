# Quiz Program Challenge

In this challenge, you will implement a program for giving multiple choice
quizzes in the terminal.

## Run the Solution

Before starting, take a look at what a final solution might look like:

From the root directory of this project, run `dotnet Solutions/Quiz.dll`

## Tasks

## Create a Menu Class

Start by creating class to represent a menu that the user can use to select from
a list of options.

### Requirements:

1. The class must have 2 properties:
   * Prompt (`string`) - Displayed above the menu
   * Options (`string[]`) - an array of options the user can select from
2. The class must have a constructor that initializes the Prompt and the Options
3. The class must have 1 method `GetChoice()`
   * This method displays the Prompt, the Options, and instructions for
     selecting an option. The user can use the up and down arrow to change their
     choice and press enter to select the currently selected option. After
     pressing enter, the method returns the selected string.

The following code should produce the picture shown below it:

```csharp
Menu menu = new("Select a Quiz", ["Math", "History", "Geography", "Science"]);
string choice = menu.GetChoice();
```

### Example: Reading Key Presses

There is an example program in the `KeyPressExample` folder that might be helpful to understand how to read a single keyboard input.

### Hint: Partial Implementation

If you're not sure how to start, there is a similar implementation in the `SimpleMenuExample` folder that might be helpful getting started with the `GetChoice()` method. Note: Your method should use up and down arrows and display a `>` on the currently selected option.

## Create a Question Class

Create a class called Question which will represent a multiple choice question in your quiz that has a single correct answer.

### Requirements

1. The Question class should have 2 properties:
   * A `Menu` with the possible options
   * A `string` that is the correct answer
2. A Constructor to initialize the menu and answer
3. A Method `AskQuestion()` which displays the menu, waits for the user to answer the question, and then returns `true` if the user selected the correct answer and `false` if the user did not select the correct answer.

*Hint*: This method should call your menu's `GetChoice()` method and then check if the returned string matches the correct answer.

If you have implemented it correctly, you should be able to write the following code in your `Program.cs`:

```csharp
Menu menu = new Menu("2 + 7", ["9", "3", "5", "27"]);
string correct = "9";
Question twoPlusSeven = new Question(menu, correct);
if(twoPlusSeven.AskQuestion())
{
   Console.WriteLine("Correct!");
}
else
{
   Console.WriteLine("That was not correct.");
}
```

## Create a Quiz Class

The `Quiz` class represents several questions that can be taken together.

### Requirements

1. A quiz has one property, an array of questions `Question[]`
2. A constructor to initialize the questions
3. A method `TakeQuiz()` that loops through each question in the quiz and calls
   `AskQuestion()`. The result of each question is displayed. Finally, after
   each question has been answered, a message is displayed showing their score
   based on how many questions were answered correctly.

When you have finished implementing the Quiz class, the following code
should work in your `Program.cs` file. The user is given a math quiz and then shown their final score.

```csharp
Quiz mathQuiz = new Quiz(
    [
        new Question(new Menu("2 + 7", ["9", "3", "5", "27"]), "9"),
        new Question(new Menu("8 x 8", ["16", "32", "88", "64"]), "64"),
        new Question(new Menu("14 รท 2", ["12", "7", "142", "8"]), "7"),
        new Question(new Menu("Solve for X: 3X - 7 = 11", ["3", "5", "6", "9"]), "6"),
        new Question(new Menu("Solve for Y: 4Y + 8 = 20", ["3", "5", "6", "9"]), "3"),
    ]
);

mathQuiz.TakeQuiz();
```

## Create a Quiz Program

Using the classes you have created, write a program that has two (or more) quizzes to choose from.

1. Show a Menu to the user and ask them to select a quiz.
2. The selected quiz should be given to the user
3. After the quiz, ask the user if they would like to take another quiz
4. If yes, go to step 1. Otherwise, exit.
